### Ultra's Wacky World of Programming

## About Me

Hi, I'm Ultra. I'm a freshman at the University of Missouri studying computer science, and I thought it was about time I did anything on here.

I like programming (shocker, I know,) gaming, all kinds of music, and writing, but I'm always looking for new hobbies because I literally don't have anything better to do in my life right now. Other than school, but *shhhh,* ***we don't need to talk about that.***

My favorite language is **C,** but considering I've only ever dabbled in it and, like, basic Python, this opinion is bound to change.

I hope we can get along :).


## Current Projects

Literally nothing, I need to figure out something to put on here. Maybe a basic array library nobody will ever use? I dunno.


## My Current Attempt at "Learning"

I'm of course working on C right now, as that's what my classes require, but I should probably look into this "OOP" thing soon enough. It shouldn't be too bad, *classes are just structs with functions in them, right?* Right.

I should also probably learn how to design good-looking text files too, that would probably be helpful.
